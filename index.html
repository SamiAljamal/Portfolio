            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>
              Hi,
              My name is Sami Al-Jamal. I'm originally from Louisiana. I'm excited to be a student at epicodus, and I'm looking forward to improve my coding skills ,and living in the great city of Portland!
            </p>
            <h4>Education & Work experience,</h4>
            <p>I recieved a B.S from Brigham Young University in Geography with an Emphasis in Georgraphic Information System in 2013. I also minored in Arabic. After graduation I took a position at <span class="links"><a href="http://www.enablemidstream.com/html/pages/p001-homepage.html">Enable Midstream Partners</a></span> as a GIS technician. I colaborated with fellow team members in creating maps depicting Gas operations as well as performing geospatial analysis and data integrity procedures.
            </p>
            <h4>Why I'm Here</h4>
            <p>
              Though I enjoyed my last job, I felt like I needed to expand my skills and experience new challenges. I'm Epicodus, because I will learn the necessary skills to become a better programer, and I beleive this program will help develop a growth-learning mindset. My goal is to one day become a GIS developer, and Epicodus is a step towards making that a reality.
            </p>
            <h4>Interests</h4>
            <p>
              I love to experience new adventures. Especially with those that I love. These are some things that I love and enjoy:
